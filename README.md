# Solar Panel Production Capacity Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the production capacity of each solar panel. The dataset used in this analysis comprises time series data, which includes weather information and specifications of each solar panel corresponding to its respective weather conditions. The primary objective is to forecast the production capacity of solar panels based on this data to contribute to the enhancement of solar panel performance, particularly in scenarios where solar energy supply is critical.

## Methodology

To achieve our goal, we employ a combination of deep learning and machine learning models:

- **Deep Learning Models:**
  - GRU Neural Network
  - CNN-LSTM

- **Ensemble Methods:**
  - RandomForest
  - Gradient Boosting (GB)
  - XGBoost

- **Machine Learning Models**

These models are chosen for their ability to process time series data accurately and efficiently.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** The dataset, comprising weather information and solar panel specifications for one of the provinces in Canada, is collected and preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the selected models.

2. **Model Training:** The preprocessed data is fed into the deep learning and machine learning models for training. During this phase, the models learn patterns from the historical data to make predictions.

3. **Prediction:** Once trained, the models are utilized to predict the production capacity of each solar panel. By leveraging current data and historical records, these predictions are made with high accuracy.

4. **Performance Improvement:** The insights gained from the predictions are utilized to enhance the performance of solar panels, particularly in conditions where solar energy supply is crucial.

## Conclusion

I believe that this project will prove to be valuable in advancing the field of solar energy generation systems. By accurately predicting the production capacity of solar panels and leveraging the insights gained, I aim to contribute to the improvement of solar panel performance, especially in scenarios where solar energy supply is critical.
